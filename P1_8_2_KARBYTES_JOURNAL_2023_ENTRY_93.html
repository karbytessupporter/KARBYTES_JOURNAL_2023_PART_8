<hr>
<p>This morning after I clocked out of work, I walked from the warehouse to the nearby Panera Bread and bought some more of that distinctly flavored hazelnut coffee and some breakfast items and sat down at a small table next to the window to use my laptop. (I was not sitting at a table in that restaurant which was close to an electrical outlet like I did a few days ago (and, while sitting at that outlet a few days ago, I plugged my laptop into that outlet and let it charge to capacity while I lightly napped for approximately half an hour while sitting at that table with my head resting on the table; enjoying the relatively pleasant music which played in the background)).</p>
<p>Today, while sitting at the non-outlet table (i.e. the small table with the number 11 on it next to the window east of the main restaurant entrance), I made some updates to probability.js such that the function which outputs an HTML string for building a table using an array as input generates a two-column table for visually depicting arrays (where the left column denotes the index number of an array element while the right column denotes the array element value which is associated with the index number in that table row (and the index numbers are listed in ascending order with index 0 in the top row)). Even though it was a relatively small code update, it made me feel like I was finally getting a chance to &#8220;come home&#8221; to who I am as a program after postponing my coding due to feeling stressed out about sleep deprivation, running out of money, insufficient travel and camping gear, and worrying about job security and being able to comfortably pursue my programming, website development, and health maintenance goals while holding down a job.</p>
<p>I was told that I have until 02_FEBRUARY_2023 to bring my social security card into the office at OnTrac. If I do not meet that deadline, then I presumably will be terminated from that job. If that happens (and I am afraid it might because the social security office said that it would take up to 14 days to mail the social security card to me (starting today (i.e. 23_JANUARY_2023)) and the deadline for bringing that social security card into the OnTrac office is less than 14 days from today (and I am also afraid that someone is going to intercept my envelope from the social security office and either make it disappear or else make it appear to have been delivered artificially late in order to sabotage my job security and to undermine my morale so that my quest to become financially self sufficient enough to completely live on my own is delayed indefinitely so that other people are not made to feel envious of my relative independence, freedom, and affluence)).</p>
<p>Because of what I said in the previous paragraph, I cannot help but feel a bit depressed (but I am doing the best I can to maintain a sense of optimism and proactivity (and it helps to be generous with myself in terms of &#8220;deadlines&#8221; for getting additional pages of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com published)). Doing an hour of code per day is better than doing none at all. Perhaps when I get my next paycheck, I will have enough money left over after purchasing a bicycle from Walmart to purchase at least one camping battery so that I can extend the battery life of my laptop and, hence, not have to spend so much time plugged into a wall outlet (and there are presently no wall outlets available to me between the hours of 8PM and 1AM on nights I have to go to Fremont to work (and I have renounced driving a car in favor of taking BART, walking, and hopefully within a week, bicycling)).</p>
<p>There are many reasons why I have renounced borrowing my mom&#8217;s gasoline powered car in favor of taking cheaper, more environmentally sustainable, and less hazardous means of transportation. I think I am a lot less likely going to get into some kind of accident as a result of not driving. I also feel like I get to see the world more when I take BART and bike or walk. Finally, I like not having to worry about the car getting broken into, stolen, towed, or otherwise damaged. If my bicycle gets damaged beyond repair or stolen and I keep my job, it would presumably only take about a week to replace that bicycle. On my own I simply cannot afford the costs of driving a car. Unlike a driving a car, riding a bicycle does not legally require that I pay hundreds of dollars per month in car insurance. Furthermore, car repairs and routine car maintenance typically cost several hundred dollars if (not thousands of dollars) per year.</p>
<p>What is particularly stressful about ordering a social security card is that I am limited to being able to order only three per year and only ten per lifetime. Hence, I think it is in my best interest to place an order for a new official birth certificate (because the copy I currently have was deemed unacceptable for some reason (and I assume it may have to do with the fact that the document is appears to be physically deteriorating due to it being more than three decades old)).</p>
<p>I just placed an order for to have a new copy of my birth certificate mailed to my legal residence for approximately $50 total (i.e. ~$30 for a copy of my birth certificate, ~7 for processing, and ~20 for shipping). Apparently, I have to fax some documents such as my driver&#8217;s license (or some other government-issued photo id) and the form which was sent to me to have a notary sign in order to proceed with the order (otherwise my money will essentially be stolen from me). I plan on using the UPS store in Castro Valley to fax the documents and the Accurate Mobile Notary in Castro Valley to get the form signed this week. (PDFs and screenshots which have my order number and pin number on them have been uploaded to one of my private GitHub repositories for safekeeping).</p>
<p>Apparently it costs $15 to get a notary&#8217;s signature on documents in California (which I apparently need to do in order to complete my birth certificate order). I also expect the faxing services to cost at least $5 per page to fax. According to what I have read online, the UPS store is able to provide notary services and faxing services by appointment.</p>
<p>I made an appointment with the UPS store in Castro Valley tomorrow to print out the authorization form for the notary to sign and fax to the number provided on the form. (It cost $5 just to print one 8&#215;11 inch page to pick up in that store tomorrow).</p>
