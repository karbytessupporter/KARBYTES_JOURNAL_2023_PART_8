<p>I shared a link to my <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_97/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous journal entry</a> on the following social media accounts: my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://twitter.com/karbytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter page</a>, my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.minds.com/karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minds page</a>, and my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=30492398" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon page</a>.  For now on, I do not intend to announce when I add or remove posts from my social media pages. (I tentatively do not plan on removing any posts from my social media accounts because what I currently have posted on those accounts provides what I think is a succinct and accurate summary of my current status in life. Also, I think that sharing links to journal entry web pages from this website on my social media accounts (in addition to sharing each new web page which I add to my primary website (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>)) will increase the likelihood that people discover that my journal website (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) and that people will peruse that website to see content which is not featured on my social media accounts. It gives me peace of mind knowing that I did everything which I thought was necessary to leave as permanent as possible of a treasure trove of personal websites on the Internet Archive&#8217;s <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> database (which I assume and hope will remain freely accessible to the public for the remainder of human civilization (which I assume and hope will last for at least 300 more years)).</p>
