<p>I shared a link to my <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_95/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous journal entry web page</a> on the following social media accounts: my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://twitter.com/karbytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter page</a>, my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.minds.com/karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minds page</a>, and my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=30492398" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon page</a>. Assuming that none of the social media posts which are currently displayed on the aforementioned social media accounts get removed, what I currently have displayed on social media is a succinct and up-to-date description of what I intend to be doing with my time short term and long term.</p>
<p>There! Now that I think I am finished articulating to the public what my plans are, I feel ready to decrease the rate at which I add new journal entry web pages to this website and, also, ready to make the subject matter which I share online (whether via my personal websites or via social networks) more narrowly focused on career-related topics (i.e. natural science, mathematics, computer programming, academic philosophy, and general personal milestones) instead of on subject matter which I think is comparatively diluted, sensationalist, and otherwise what I deem to be insufficiently professional in terms of quality.</p>
