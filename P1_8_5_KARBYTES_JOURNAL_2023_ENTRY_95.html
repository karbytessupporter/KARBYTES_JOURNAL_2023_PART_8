<p>My tentative career goal which I intend to accomplish within the next two years includes supporting myself financially by doing a package handling job while using my free time to develop my personal websites (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and at least one separate website which is devoted entirely to showcasing my best software engineering examples, resume, and other information which is designed to appeal to prospective employers) and then, once I feel confident enough in my software engineering skills to land an entry level job in the information technology sector, send out job applications to local entry level software engineering, quality assurance, and other information technology positions which appeal to my interests until I get hired at one of those jobs (and then to stay hired at that job for at least one year).</p>
